Project XX: “In vivo calcium imaging in freely-behaving mice using open-source miniscopes”.
Instructor: J. Quinn Lee, PhD (Douglas Mental Health University Institute, USA)
Abstract
Recent technological innovations now allow for imaging of large neural populations in
freely-behaving animals across protracted experience (weeks-months) using miniaturized
microscopes (miniscopes). While several groups have produced such technology for use in
neuroscience experiments, among the most popular versions is the open-source miniscope
developed at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). Importantly, this version of the
miniscope is highly adaptable, and available to users at a fraction of the cost compared to
commercially-available systems. In this course, students will learn how to construct and
repair the UCLA miniscope, to perform surgical procedures for in vivo calcium imaging, how
to carry out freely-behaving imaging experiments, and to use open-source python-based
analysis methods for calcium imaging data (CaImAn) and animal behavior (Deeplabcut).
