Project: "Computational analytical methods to link high-dimensional neuronal population and behavioral data"

Instructor: Steeve Laquitaine, PhD (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Switzerland)

Abstract: Modern technical innovations now allow experimentalists to measure and manipulate the dynamic distributed activity of large populations of neurons in behaving animals. With recent progress in machine learning, they now also have the capability to link neural population activity with behavior in real-time, across days, across a wide range of tasks and animals. The massive datasets generated have stimulated the rise of an Open Science framework to store, share and accelerate data and analyses within the Neuroscience community, in a standardized and reproducible manner. At the end of the course students will be able to locate, retrieve datasets made available by the research community and to share their own with the community. They will know how to use state-of-the-art modeling and visualisation techniques, via discovery-driven and hypothesis-driven approaches, to identify factors that explain joint changes in neural activity and behavior in 2P ca-imaging, extracellular electrophysiological recording experiments, across species. They will learn to identify the neurons that contribute to these variations. They will understand the advantages and limitations of traditional and popular modern techniques and know how to use them to arbitrate between techniques.

Objectives:
- They will know how to use the Allen Institute SDK, browse the Dandi archive, FigShare, dataryad to retrieve and share standardized, repropducible datasets and code.
- They will understand the advantages and limitations of the most popular analytical techniques
- Students will know how to implement and rule out models that link neuronal activity to behavior

Methodology: 
- Analysis of neuropixels recordings and ca-imaging of cortical activity in mice viewing natural scenes (de Vries et al., 2020, Allen Institute dataset), 
- Analysis of tetrode recordings of Hippocampus activity in mice during virtual navigation (Grossmark, Buzsaki, Science, 2016), 
- Analysis of DREAD manipulation and ca-imaging of cortical activity in mice during reward-based navigation (Krishnan et al., Nat Commun, 2022)
- Analysis of 100-electrode array recording of monkeys' motor cortical activity during motor reaching (Chowdhury et al., elife, 2020).
- Traditional and state-of-the art machine learning-based dimensionality reduction techniques, topological data analysis of neural manifolds
- Programming in Python, low-code for beginners, full code available for tuning
- Programming in Google Colab, on Laptop
